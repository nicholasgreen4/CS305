**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?**
Artemis Financial is a consulting company specializing in developing personalized financial plans for clients, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Artemis Financial is seeking to modernize its operations through a new RESTful web application that will handle sensitive financial data. The primary issue the company wants to address is the security of this web application. They need to ensure that their application is protected from external threats and adheres to the latest and most effective security practices to safeguard financial information and comply with relevant data protection regulations.

**What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?**
When evaluating Artemis Financial's software security vulnerabilities, I conducted a comprehensive assessment that included manual code review and static analysis, ensuring no potential issues were overlooked. I provided detailed documentation on the results of the assessment. 
Secure coding is important as sensitive data must be protected from unauthorized access. Secure coding can prevent exploits by reducing vulnerabilities, and ensures compliance with data protection regulations. This commitment to security not only keeps client information secure, but also enchances the company's reputation.

**Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**
The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was the manual code review. Identifying vulnerabilities within a codebase requires meticulous attention to detail and a deep understanding of portential security risks. The process is time-consuming and tedious, however, it also provides direct insight into how vulnerabilities may be introduced and allows for precise recommendations to prevent them.

**How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**
To increase the layers of security for Artemis Financial's application, I implemented input validation and secured credential storage, as well as manual code review. In the future, I would like to use threat modeling to understand potential areas of attack, and penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks.

**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**
For future assignments, I would like to use automated security tools like Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), manual code reviews, and comprehensive unit tests. I would also like to try using a dependency managemtn tools like Depndabot to keep third party libraries updated and secure.

**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**
To showcase my skills and experience to future employers, I could present this vulnerability assessment report which highlights my ability to identify and document security vulnerabilities and recommend effective remediation strategies. I would emphasize the secure coding practices I implemented, and I would highlight my use of security tools and manual code reviews.
